This is a fork of the [weather app](https://github.com/dev-aniketj/WeatherApp-Android) originally created by [@dev-aniketj](https://github.com/dev-aniketj) that adds firebase authentication integration and a profile/user feature.

In order for it to work, please add your API key to the LocationCord.java and your firebase google-services.json file in the root of the app directory.
